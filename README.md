function-points
===============

Taken from the concept of Function Points in software project management, this system takes activity data given by committees (through a Google form) and allows the user to assign a "function point" score for the activity. Using these scores, the system generates a set of data to track each committee's productivity.

Set up your Google Docs file system to organize your committees:

In each folder, have a spreadsheet to catch form data. FunctionPoints will automatically set up your sheet so that it looks like this (excluding the graph... Google Code doesn't yet allow those graphs to be generated automatically)

Function Points are set up to work with a summary page
